1 # Citation for the following files: cars.hbs, customers.hbs, locations.hbs, transactions.hbs, transactionCars.hbs, deleteCar.hbs,deleteCustomer.hbs, deleteLocation.hbs, deleteTransaction.hbs, deleteTransactionCar.hbs, index.hbs, main.css
2 # Date: 02/13/2025
3 # Templated from bsg_HTML_UI
4 # The main things used from the template was the functionality of the buttons, and the 
#  table layout, with a little difference in functionality, however the skeleton is similar
#  to the template. What is original is the design thought and process of creating the table 
#  with a CSS file in mind to make styling easier for us. And the topic of ideas we have given
#  the skeleton making the UI fit towards our project idea and topic.
